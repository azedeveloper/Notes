## About

This is a note website where you can make your own notes, It was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Vanilla).

## Features

- Sticky Notes
- Edit/Delete Notes
- Dark Mode


## Security

This site does not publish any of your notes to the internet. **All of the notes are saved in your browsers local storage** 🌐

The notes are saved like this:
```
localStorage.setItem("notes", JSON.stringify(notes));
```


This means that using something like **incognito mode** won't save your notes. 🕵️


## Mobile Compatibility 
------
The mobile version of the site is currently still being worked on. It might work on mobile but not looks the best.📱

Update: I'm almost finished with the mobile version of the site, it looks alot better now. Might still be some issues, if there are please report them!


## Known Issues 🛑
------

- **The dark/light mode might be broken if you have dark mode on phone.**
